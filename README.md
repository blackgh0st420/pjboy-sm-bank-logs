# PJ's Bank Logs

This is a Git mirror of the [SM bank logs](https://patrickjohnston.org/bank/index.html) by [PJBoy](https://github.com/PJBoy). All credit goes to them.

This repo is automatically updated once a day, so it might be out of date at any given time, as well as missing intermediate revisions. For the most up-to-date logs always check the website.

## Manual update Instructions

**NOTE:** A Github Action automatically performs these steps once a day.

- Download `banklogs.zip` from https://patrickjohnston.org/ziplogs.php
- Extract overwriting existing files, and commit any new changes.

## `disasm-tags` branch

The purpose of the `disasm-tags` branch is to add annotations to guide a (currently unpublished) fork of `sm_banklog_parser` to better format the output of things such as spritemaps and instruction lists.

The branch will be ocasionally merged with `main` to receive any new corrections or additions to the logs.
